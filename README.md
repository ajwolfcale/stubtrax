# Stubtrax


## Stubtrax was created to help people keep keep track of their personal and business expenses, as well as prepare for everyone's favorite time of year, tax-season.
Receipts can be tough to keep track of. They're usually lost within hours of making a purchase,never to be seen again. Stubtrax allows you to store expenses by uploading images of your receipts and filling out an expense form which is saved to your profile. Eventually, you may need to retrieve old expenses that you've made throughout the year. Head over to the "My Expenses" page to see every expense that you've saved. Looking for that big tax write-off from way back in January? By now, you've probably entered way too many expenses to meticulously search through each individual expense. Click on our "filters" button and find exactly what you are looking for! You can search between dates by category, business/personal expenses, tax write-offs, or combination of these.
